Description

Howdy World, I work on growth and commercial strategies for VCs and start-ups. Here is selection of side projects where I pushed myself to wear a coding hat (and headphones) instead. 

I follow the freecodecamp.org curriculum, so mostly basic frontend development for now, stay tuned for more interesting stuff later.
